## About Me

Hello! I'm a Spanish Computer Science student pursuing a Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science Research at
[Paris Cit√© University](https://u-paris.fr/en/). You can also check out my [CV](https://github.com/Yag000/cv).

## Interests

My primary interests lie in:

- **Programming Language Theory**
- **Functional Programming**
- **Type Theory**

I am also eager to explore other areas of Computer Science and Mathematics.

## Current Learning Focus

At the moment, I am working on improving my knowledge of proof assistants such as Coq, writing a lot of functional programming (OCaml...) and spending too much time
writing LaTeX notes for my courses.

## Projects

I maintain several small Rust projects:

- [**enum_stringify**](https://github.com/Yag000/enum_stringify): Macros to generate string conversion functions for enums.
- [**wallshift**](https://github.com/Yag000/wallshift): A wallpaper changer powered by `feh` (for now...).
- [**quick-links-rofi**](https://github.com/Yag000/quick-links-rofi): A Rust program to launch a Rofi menu with a collection of links.
- [**asoiaf-rs**](https://github.com/Yag000/asoiaf-rs): A Rust wrapper for [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/).
- [**lotr-api-rs**](https://github.com/Yag000/lotr-api-rs): A Rust wrapper for [The One API to Rule Them All](https://the-one-api.dev/).
- [**chimpanzee**](https://github.com/Yag000/chimpanzee): A [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) interpreter, compiler, and formatter in Rust, with additional features.

## Key Skills and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Rust, OCaml, Coq, LaTeX, Python, Java, C, Bash, and Prolog.
- **Functional Programming:** Proficient in functional programming concepts and techniques.
- **Version Control:** Experienced in Git for version control and collaborative development.
- **GNU/Linux Environments:** Skilled with GNU/Linux command-line tools and scripting. Arch Linux is my daily driver.
- **Mathematics:** Strong foundation in mathematical concepts, particularly as they apply to problem-solving.
