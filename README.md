## About Me

Hello! I am a Spanish Computer Science and Mathematics student at [Paris Cit√© University](https://u-paris.fr/en/)

## Interests

My main areas of interest are Programming Language Theory, Functional Programming, and Type Theory. However, I am also open to exploring any other field of Computer Science or Mathematics.

## Current Learning Focus

At the moment, I am actively learning and improving my skills in Rust and furthering my knowledge of OCaml.

## Projects

During my free time, I am developing a set of tools for the [Monkey Programming Language](https://monkeylang.org/).
The idea is to develop a compiler/interpreter for the language, a formatter, a linter, and a language server in rust. You can follow
the development of the project [here](https://github.com/Yag000/chimpanzee).

## Key skills and Technologies

- Programming Languages: Rust, OCaml, Python, Java, C and Bash.
- Functional Programming: Experience with functional programming concepts and techniques.
- Version Control: Proficient in using Git for version control and collaborative development.
- GNU/Linux Environments: Familiarity with GNU/Linux command-line tools and scripting. I use Arch as my daily driver.
- Mathematics: Solid foundation in mathematical concepts and their application to problem-solving.
